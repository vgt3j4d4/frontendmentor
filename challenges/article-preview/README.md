## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create the bottom triangle used in the tooltip. I might have used it in the past but I didn't recall. I also learned how to use the `checkVisibility()` function from the HTML Elements.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about tooltips and how to render them. I mean, I'll like the code associated to tooltips not really in the dom until it's needed. I know how to do it but not sure it it's too much overhead.

### Useful resources

- [checkVisibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/checkVisibility) - Helped me to check if an element is visible or not, using JavaScript.
