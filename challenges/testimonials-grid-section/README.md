## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I remembered how to position background images:

From styles.scss:

```
&.testimonial-daniel {
    background-color: $color-moderate-violet;
    background-image: url("../images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top right rem(24);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll keep reviewing css grid and try to learn more about it.

### Useful resources
